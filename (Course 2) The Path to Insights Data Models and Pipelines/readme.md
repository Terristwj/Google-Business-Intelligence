## About this Course

This is the second of three courses in the Google Business Intelligence Certificate. In this course, you'll explore data modeling and how databases are designed. Then youâ€™ll learn about extract, transform, load (ETL) processes that extract data from source systems, transform it into formats that enable analysis, and drive business processes and goals.

Google employees who currently work in BI will guide you through this course by providing hands-on activities that simulate job tasks, sharing examples from their day-to-day work, and helping you build business intelligence skills to prepare for a career in the field.

Learners who complete the three courses in this certificate program will have the skills needed to apply for business intelligence jobs. This certificate program assumes prior knowledge of foundational analytical principles, skills, and tools covered in the Google Data Analytics Certificate.
